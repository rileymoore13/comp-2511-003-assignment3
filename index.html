        <h2>Who the HELL is Riley?</h2>
        <p >
          <br />
          Hi I'm Riley. I am currently a student at Mount Royal University
          taking a degree in the Bachelor of Computer Information Systems. For
          my job, I am a ski instructor. Our club mostly skis at Winsport and
          Sunshine Resort. <br /><br /><br />
          Aside from work and school, I enjoy many other outdoor activities! In
          the warm months I will ride my bike in the city and go on big hikes in
          the rockies. Most of all, I love rock climbing. I started a few years
          ago at the MRU climbing wall and since then I've learned all sorts of
          things about climbing, and even had the privilege of climbing outdoors
          a few times!
